For this last project, my aim was to use the time and resources to develop a personal project of mine which I would like
to complete one day. One of my life ambitions is to make commercial games but with my Fine Arts background
it can sometime feel difficult to find an in-between and this passion project is definitely a somewhat tongue-in-cheek
exploration of a hybrid between the two worlds. The pitch for the project is as following: the player incarnates Drew, prince of 
a painted world ruled by his father, the king of hearts, and his mother, the queen of spades. When the king develops a sickness that 
slowly makes him lose his colors, Drew must travel through the different painted realms and find the 7 incarnations of the rainbow 
colors to cure his father. The idea with the painted worlds is to include in a gamic environment various art movements and styles, 
play around with and recontextualize some of those iconic fine arts figures. Some example of this is in the design of the main characters, 
such as a Drew who has a "manga" aesthetic despite being the child of classic European-styled cards (a crucial plot-point); two of Drew's 
companions, one being a typical Renoir young girl and the other being a Picasso-like entity; and various encountered characters such as the 
girl with the pearl earring (who turns out to be a transgender), the scream (who becomes thus because of his encounter with Drew and co.), 
a room full of Frida Kalhos and the elusive Mona Lisa. It was interesting to try and develop this project in Creative Computation, as much 
of the work done so far on it is conception and plotline elements. I enjoyed being in the challenging position of developing the actual 
interactive experience and start thinking concretely about and prototyping the mechanics of the game. One interesting element proposed by 
Pippin was to have the beat-em-all component be mixed with a painting mechanic, to go along with the theme of the game, which wasn't
something I had ever thought of but which now feels like an integral part of the project as it definitely gives it an additional quirk that 
fits the world. Unfortunately a lot of time was put in understanding Phaser and getting to the results sought after so the project is very
prototypical and unfortunately in some ways lacking, though the period in the year and accumulation of fed up-ness with demands of school and
work have taken their toll on my motivation and involvement in what I do. Hopefully this will be possible to be broguht to the next level
recently, maybe still with Phaser though I will have to look at alternatives that are could be more accessible.
